100 ML Projects


## Goal

As a Software Engineer by day, I don't always have time to practice and improve skills in ML development.

I hope to remedy that by working on projects as close to daily as possible. I hope to even share code with #100ML hashtag

Not all of these will be end-to-end projects. I hope to dabble in many areas and in many frameworks.

Hopefully this will build an intuition not just in architecting models, but data preparation, serving and MLOps.


Here's the 8 steps from Hands-On ML book that will be in most project README's 

1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture
2. Get the data
3. Explore the data to gain insights
4. Prepare the data to beter expose theunderlying data patterns to Machine Learning algorithms
5. Explore many different models and shortlist the best ones.
6. Fine-tune your models and combine them into a greate solution.
7. Present your solution 
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
